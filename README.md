# xadisk

This project was originally hosted on xadisk.java.net, and is now migrated here.

XADisk (pronounced 'x-a-disk') enables transactional access to existing file systems by providing APIs to perform file/directory operations. With simple steps, it can be deployed over any JVM and can then start serving all kinds of Java/JavaEE application running anywhere.

XADisk supports both normal and distributed (XA) transactions, can recover from application crashes, resolve deadlocks and provides many other useful features. It can be used in a variety of Java environments:

    XADisk Jar - Deploys over any JVM, including standalone Java applications, Web Servers, JavaEE Servers.
    XADisk Rar - Fully JCA compliant and deploys over any JavaEE Server.
